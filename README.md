# 1.5D-DW-PhysChem-Schrodinger-Assignment
Code for describing Schrodinger's Equation and visualizing orbitals

•Rydberg Energy describes the energy equation between atomic number and energy of the atom\
•Cart to Sphere is a helper function to convert from Cartesian to Spherical coordinates\
•Legendre and Leguerre describes the Legendre and Leguerre part of the Schrodinger equation\ 
•Assoc_wave_func creates the associated Leguerre wave function\
•Hydrogen WF gives the hydrogen wave function using the above functions\
•Dump data plots all the data in the work function and stores them in a file\
•Plotter plots the orbital shapes\
